Credits go especially to kiwi.ds - without NDS Edit
and the source code for the NSBMD viewer, this thing
would never have been possible!

Also thanks for SCV's modification of the original viewer's
source code for supporting more texture formats.

Special thanks go to FLOPPEI for introducing me to the world
of NDS homebrew / hacking (it's awesome :) and testing this thing
out.
