PG4Map - a 4th Gen Pokémon MapViewer
====================================

Executables are in the folder 'build'.
Before you run it, please _make sure_ to
follow the steps outlined in
tutorial.pdf!!!

You also definitely need an installation
of .NET Framework 3.5 on your machine.
If you don't have it (yet), go download it
from www.microsoft.com!

Please acknowledge that I don't even
consider this an alpha version of a
complete map viewer.
This means basically that I'm not
responsible for any (although highly unlikely)
damage this program may cause to you or your
computer.

This was released with the intention of
creating _at least something_ that could
possibly display maps and aid other
ROM hackers / programmers in the creation
of real viewer / editor tools for the NDS
Pokémon games.
